{"text": "statement of findings the united states supreme court has found that a lack of maturity and an underdeveloped sense of responsibility are found in youth more often than in adults and are more understandable among the young these qualities often result in impetuous and actions and decisions it has further found that juveniles are more vulnerable or susceptible to negative influences and outside pressures including peer pressure y outh is more than a chronological fact it is a time and condition of life when a person may be most susceptible to influence and to psychological damage this is explained in part by the prevailing circumstance that juveniles have less control or less experience with control over their own environment children need access to counsel when they come in contact with the juvenile justice system the role of the juvenile defender is complex and reflects the unique status of childhood in terms of immaturity disability and trauma the juvenile defender must be knowledgeable as to legal jurisprudence relating to the representation of children including child development capacity to participate in legal proceedings methods and effectiveness and availability of treatment and dispositional alternatives juvenile defenders play a critical role in the fair administration of justice for children including both legal and extralegal processes counsel must receive appropriate training in juvenile justice law and statutes services for children communication with children in a developmentally appropriate and effective manner effective interviewing techniques involving children and to recognize how trauma disability and immaturity affect the behavior and relationships of young people effective representation of youth requires consultation and advocacy at the earliest stage possible and until the child is no longer subject to the juvenile justice system the courts have long noted that young persons are more susceptible to police coercion and in more need of counsel when facing police questioning special protection is particularly necessary in the context of affording young persons their miranda rights as they are less capable of comprehending such warnings than adults the supreme court ruled in that the age of the suspect can determine whether a person is in custody for purposes of miranda it is beyond dispute that
