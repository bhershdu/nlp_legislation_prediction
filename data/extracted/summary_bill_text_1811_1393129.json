{"text": "intent new hampshire has a unique tax structure with no general sales tax or income tax and no severance tax on natural resources new hampshire relies on its business profits tax corporate income tax more than any other state and most countries during the legislature s session the business profits tax law was changed to allow the department of revenue administration or taxpayers to employ the combined reporting method of taxation under the unitary business principle before this change large corporations were allowed to file their business profits tax returns on a separate accounting separate entity basis as if unconnected and unrelated to its affiliated sister corporations this separate method of taxation is inadequate to measure accurately the income of a corporation with hampshire affiliates and creates a tax disadvantage for smaller new hampshire corporations which compete with larger multistate and multinational corporations conducting business in new hampshire combined reporting treats a parent corporation and its subsidiaries both in the united states and foreign as if a single taxpayer the purpose of combined reporting is to counteract the profit shifting that takes place between and among a parent and its subsidiaries operating across state lines and international boundaries the united states supreme court endorsed the unitary business principle in the decision in mobil vs commissioner of taxes vermont and exxon vs wisconsin department of revenue and in approved worldwide combined reporting in the decision in container corporation vs franchise tax board california the united states supreme court revisited the worldwide combined reporting method in in the decisions in barclays bank plc vs franchise tax board california and vs franchise tax board california and approved it use for both united states and multinational corporations the court noted that during the intervening years congress did not pass any laws to prohibit a state from utilizing the worldwide combined reporting method bowing to pressure from the reagan administration multinational corporations foreign countries especially great britain and the new hampshire governor the legislature in changed the business profits tax law to restrict state s ability to employ the worldwide unitary method of taxation and in it s place adopt the water s edge unitary method which excludes the profits and operations of foreign members of a unitary group in other words a multinational corporation is separated into two distinct pieces one operating in the united states and another operating outside the united states and treated as unrelated separate taxable entities in hindsight and with reports of massive profit shifting to foreign subsidiaries in foreign tax havens over the intervening years the change to the business profits tax was a mistake and should be reversed in hindsight the water s edge method defeats the purpose of unitary combined reporting the water s edge method promotes tax havens like bermuda and luxembourg and encourages the shifting of profits from the united states to foreign tax havens compounding this mistake is the unintended consequence of the water s edge method that grants a tax advantage to foreign based corporations with united states subsidiaries operating in new hampshire their united states subsidiaries have been allowed to file their business profits tax returns on a separate accounting separate entity basis under the water s edge method the federal general accountability office gao and a united states senate committee on governmental affairs have reported that as high as foreign based corporations that do business in the united states have paid zero federal income tax this creates a tax disadvantage for united corporations big and small it is the intent of this act to treat all corporations conducting a unitary business fairly and equally no matter how big no matter where the headquarters are located in addition a return to the unitary worldwide method will counteract the negative effects of the territorial taxation system that was adopted in the federal tax cut and jobs act the territorial system is more or less the separate accounting separate entity method that is inadequate to measure accurately the income of a corporation with hampshire affiliates repeals water s edge combined reporting for
