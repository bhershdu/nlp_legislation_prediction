the total of all continuing ballots that could possibly be transferred to the candidate in future rounds from candidates with fewer active preferences or an equal number of active preferences would not be enough to surpass the candidate with the next higher active preference total in the round the candidate has a lower active preference total than a candidate described in subparagraph c

difference between such elected candidate s total number of active preferences and the election threshold h exhausted ballot means a ballot that does not rank any continuing candidate contains an overvote at the highest continuing ranking or contains or more sequential skipped rankings before its highest continuing ranking i highest continuing ranking means the highest ranking on a voter s ballot for a continuing candidate j candidate means the candidate with the lowest active preference total in a round of the voting tabulation or any other candidate subject to batch elimination k

not counted for any continuing candidate the round then ends with one of the following potential outcomes to be tested sequentially a if one or more continuing candidates have a number of active preferences that are greater than or equal to the election threshold such candidates are determined to be winners of the election by a plurality of votes if the number of candidates determined to have been winners of the election collectively and in any round equals the number of members to be elected in a particular representative district the tabulation shall then cease if the number of

values of the active preferences for the elected candidates in the current round are calculated and a new round begins b if the number of continuing candidates plus elected candidates equals the number of members to be elected in a particular representative district then all remaining continuing candidates shall be determined to be winners of the election by a plurality of votes and the
