{"text": "title this act may be known and cited as the civil liberties defense act legislative findings rsa and together known as the emergency powers statutes allow the governor of new hampshire to declare a state of emergency and thereby activate emergency powers the emergency powers statutes were passed by the general court in order to give the governor flexible enumerated powers in a time of public disaster on friday march the governor issued executive order declaring a state of emergency due to the novel coronavirus or this order formed the basis for several emergency orders on tuesday march binford et al v sununu became the first legal challenge to these emergency orders the lawsuit claimed that aspects of the orders violated the plaintiffs civil liberties in response to this lawsuit the state rather than arguing simply that the orders in question were constitutional disturbingly asked the new hampshire superior court to hold that civil liberties are suspended due to the state of emergency see binford et al v sununu merrimack cty super ct at march kissinger j the state contends that during a state of emergency executives are granted broad latitude to suspend civil liberties the superior court agreed with the state and concluded that civil liberties in new hampshire are suspended during the emergency id at affirming that i n an emergency situation fundamental rights such as the right of travel and free speech may be suspended quoting smith v avino f d th cir id at the court finds that the governor may suspend constitutional rights during a state of emergency although the superior court then proceeded to find that the governor s orders were constitutional it noted that it was doing so only for the purpose of establishing a complete record id in subsequent emergency orders the governor has cited the superior court s opinion letter in binford as a legal authority see e g emergency order no at nov citing binford et al v sununu merrimack cty super ct in enacting rsa and the general court intended to give the governor flexible enumerated powers during a time of disaster it did not intend to allow the governor to suspend or otherwise infringe upon the new hampshire bill of rights or the united states constitution the general court makes no comment on the specific outcome of the binford decision recognizing that applications of legal rights are within the province of the judicial branch yet the superior court exceeded its authority to the extent that it purported to authorize the governor to suspend or infringe upon the new hampshire bill of rights or the united states constitution civil liberties are a codification of the inherent and binding duties of governments to their citizens the rule of law in a free society must therefore be permanent and inviolable the new hampshire bill of rights and the united states constitution may never be suspended set aside or otherwise nullified by the governor the judiciary this general court or any other official authority government is not free to disregard the first amendment in times of crisis roman catholic diocese of brooklyn v cuomo u s ____ gorsuch j concurring in the judgment since the binford decision was issued the united states supreme court has correctly reaffirmed that even in a pandemic the constitution cannot be put away and forgotten roman catholic diocese of brooklyn v cuomo u s ____ the united states supreme court has never held that constitutional rights may be suspended due to a pandemic roman catholic diocese of brooklyn v cuomo u s ____ gorsuch j concurring in the judgment jacobson didn t seek to depart from normal legal rules during a pandemic and it supplies no precedent for doing so instead jacobson applied what would become the traditional legal test associated with the right at issue exactly what the court does today citing jacobson v massachusetts u s id nor does any dissenting justice in the cuomo decision seek to explain why anything other than our usual constitutional standards should apply during the current pandemic the general court does not seek to obstruct lawful efforts by the governor or the governor s officials to manage public disasters yet new hampshire courts may not depart from the federal or state constitutions during a crisis given the alarming nature of the state s argument in binford and the superior court s resulting findings the general court concludes that it would be negligent to wait for action by the new hampshire supreme court before enacting this legislation purpose the purposes of this act are to clarify that the general court never intended that emergency powers granted to the governor would be used to suspend civil liberties and to amend the emergency powers statutes to expressly prohibit the suspension of civil liberties to reject as ultra vires and to preclude any judicial decision purporting to suspend civil liberties in new hampshire whether reached under the emergency powers statutes or any other law or legal principle to ensure that even in a pandemic the constitution cannot be put away and forgotten roman catholic diocese of brooklyn v cuomo u s ____ legal
