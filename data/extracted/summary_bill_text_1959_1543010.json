{"text": "whereas the constitution of the state of new hampshire part article declares that the people of this state have the sole and exclusive right of governing themselves as a free sovereign and independent state and do and forever hereafter shall exercise and enjoy every power jurisdiction and right pertaining thereto which is not or may not hereafter be by them expressly delegated to the united states of america in congress assembled and whereas the constitution of the state of new hampshire part article declares that the people inhabiting the territory formerly called the province of new hampshire do hereby solemnly and mutually agree with each other to form themselves into a free sovereign and independent or state by the name of the state of new hampshire and whereas the state of new hampshire when ratifying the constitution for the united states of america recommended as a change first that it be explicitly declared that all powers not expressly particularly delegated by the aforesaid are reserved to the several states to be by them exercised and whereas the other states that included recommendations to wit massachusetts new york north carolina rhode island and virginia included an identical or similar recommended change and whereas these recommended changes were incorporated as the ninth amendment the enumeration in the constitution of certain rights shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people and the tenth amendment the powers not delegated to the united states by the constitution nor prohibited by it to the states are reserved to the states respectively or to the people to the constitution for the united states of america now therefore be it resolved by the house of representatives the senate concurring that the several states composing the united states of america are not united on the principle of unlimited submission to their general government but that by a compact under the style and title of a constitution for the united states and of amendments thereto they constituted a general government for special purposes delegated to that government certain definite powers reserving each state to itself the residuary mass of right to their own and that whensoever the general government assumes undelegated powers its acts are unauthoritative void and of no force that to this compact each state acceded as a state and is an integral party its forming as to itself the other party that the government created by this compact was not made the exclusive or final judge of the extent of the powers delegated to itself since that would have made its discretion and not the constitution the measure of its powers but that as in all other cases of compact among powers having no common judge each party has an equal right to judge for itself as well of infractions as of the mode and measure of redress and that the constitution of the united states having delegated to congress a power to punish treason counterfeiting the securities and current coin of the united states piracies and felonies committed on the high seas and offenses against the law of nations slavery and no other crimes whatsoever and it being true as a general principle and one of the amendments to the constitution having also declared that the powers not delegated to the united states by the constitution nor prohibited by it to the states are reserved to the states respectively or to the people therefore all acts of congress which assume to create define or punish crimes other than those so enumerated in the constitution are altogether void and of no force and that the power to create define and punish such other crimes is reserved and of right appertains solely and exclusively to the respective states each within its own territory and that it is true as a general principle and is also expressly declared by one of the amendments to the constitution that the powers not delegated to the united states by the constitution nor prohibited by it to the states are reserved to the states respectively or to the people and that no power over the freedom of religion freedom of speech or freedom of the press being delegated to the united states by the constitution nor prohibited by it to the states all lawful powers respecting the same did of right remain and were reserved to the states or the people that thus was manifested their determination to retain to themselves the right of judging how far the licentiousness of speech and of the press may be abridged without lessening their useful freedom and how far those abuses which cannot be separated from their use should be tolerated rather than the use be destroyed and thus also they guarded against all abridgment by the united states of the freedom of religious opinions and exercises and retained to themselves the right of protecting the same and that in addition to this general principle and express declaration another and more special provision has been made by one of the amendments to the constitution which expressly declares that congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof or abridging the freedom of speech or of the press thereby guarding in the same sentence and under the same words the freedom of religion of speech and of the press insomuch that whatever violated either throws down the sanctuary which covers the others and that libels falsehood and defamation equally with heresy and false religion are withheld from the cognizance of federal tribunals that therefore all acts of congress of the united states which do abridge the freedom of religion freedom of speech freedom of the press are not law but are altogether void and of no force and that the construction applied by the general government as is evidenced by sundry of their proceedings to those parts of the constitution of the united states which delegate to congress a power to lay and collect taxes duties imports and excises to pay the debts and provide for the common defense and general welfare of the united states and to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the powers vested by the constitution in the government of the united states or in any department or officer thereof goes to the destruction of all limits prescribed to their power by the constitution that words meant by the instrument to be subsidiary only to the execution of limited powers ought not to be so construed as themselves to give unlimited powers nor a part to be so taken as to destroy the whole residue of that instrument that the proceedings of the general government under color of these articles will be a fit and necessary subject of revisal and correction and that a committee of conference and correspondence be appointed which shall have as its charge to communicate the preceding resolutions to the legislatures of the several states to assure them that this state continues in the same esteem of their friendship and union which it has manifested from that moment at which a common danger first suggested a common union that it considers union for specified national purposes and particularly to those specified in their federal compact to be friendly to the peace happiness and prosperity of all the states that faithful to that compact according to the plain intent and meaning in which it was understood and acceded to by the several parties it is sincerely anxious for its preservation that it does also believe that to take from the states all the powers of and transfer them to a general and consolidated government without regard to the special delegations and reservations solemnly agreed to in that compact is not for the peace happiness or prosperity of these states and that therefore this state is determined as it doubts not its are to submit to undelegated and consequently unlimited powers in no man or body of men on earth that in cases of an abuse of the delegated powers the members of the general government being chosen by the people a change by the people would be the constitutional remedy but where powers are assumed which have not been delegated a nullification of the act is the rightful remedy that every state has a natural right in cases not within the compact casus non foederis to nullify of their own authority all assumptions of power by others within their limits that without this right they would be under the dominion absolute and unlimited of whosoever might exercise this right of judgment for them that nevertheless this state from motives of regard and respect for its has wished to communicate with them on the subject that with them alone it is proper to communicate they alone being parties to the compact and solely authorized to judge in the last resort of the powers exercised under it congress being not a party but merely the creature of the compact and subject as to its assumptions of power to the final judgment of those by whom and for whose use itself and its powers were all created and modified that if the acts before specified should stand these conclusions would flow from them that it would be a dangerous delusion were a confidence in the men of our choice to silence our fears for the safety of our rights that confidence is everywhere the parent of despotism free government is founded in jealousy and not in confidence it is jealousy and not confidence which prescribes limited constitutions to bind down those whom we are obliged to trust with power that our constitution has accordingly fixed the limits to which and no further our confidence may go in questions of power then let no more be heard of confidence in man but bind him down from mischief by the chains of the constitution that this state does therefore call on its for an expression of their sentiments on acts not authorized by the federal compact and it doubts not that their sense will be so announced as to prove their attachment unaltered to limited government whether general or particular and that the rights and liberties of their will be exposed to no dangers by remaining embarked in a common bottom with their own that they will concur with this state in considering acts as so palpably against the constitution as to amount to an undisguised declaration that the compact is not meant to be the measure of the powers of the general government but that it will proceed in the exercise over these states of all powers whatsoever that they will view this as seizing the rights of the states and consolidating them in the hands of the general government with a power assumed to bind the states not merely as the cases made federal casus foederis but in all cases whatsoever by laws made not with their consent but by others against their consent that this would be to surrender the form of government we have chosen and live under one deriving its powers from its own will and not from our authority and that the recurring to their natural right in cases not made federal will concur in declaring these acts void and of no force and will each take measures of its own for providing that neither these acts nor any others of the general government not plainly and intentionally authorized by the constitution shall be exercised within their respective territories and that the said committee be authorized to communicate by writing or personal conferences at any times or places whatever with any person or person who may be appointed by any one or more to correspond or confer with them and that they lay their proceedings before the next session of the general court and that any act by the congress of the united states executive order of the president of the united states of america or judicial order by the judicatories of the united states of america which assumes a power not delegated to the government of united states of america by the constitution for the united states of america and which serves to diminish the liberty of the any of the several states or their citizens shall constitute a nullification of the constitution for the united states of america by the government of the united states of america acts which would cause such a nullification include but are not limited to establishing martial law or a state of emergency within one of the states comprising the united states of america without the consent of the legislature of that state requiring involuntary servitude or governmental service other than a draft during a declared war or pursuant to or as an alternative to incarceration after due process of law requiring involuntary servitude or governmental service of persons under the age of other than pursuant to or as an alternative to incarceration after due process of law surrendering any power delegated or not delegated to any corporation or foreign government any act regarding religion further limitations on freedom of political speech or further limitations on freedom of the press further infringements on the right to keep and bear arms including prohibitions of type or quantity of arms or ammunition and that should any such act of congress become law or executive order or judicial order be put into force all powers delegated to the united states of america by the constitution for the united states shall revert to the several states individually as any such act shall constitute a direct challenge to the constitution for the united states of america by the government and must be considered at best an act of open hostility and at worst an act of war upon the states any future government of the united states of america shall require ratification of three quarters of the states seeking to form a government of the united states of america and shall not be binding upon any state not seeking to form such a government and that copies of this resolution be transmitted by the house clerk to the president of the united states each member of the united states congress and the presiding officers of each state s legislature", "status": 2, "party": 1}
