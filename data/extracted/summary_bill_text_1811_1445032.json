hampshire s economy includes but is not limited to capital investments by the renewable energy generation facility employment resulting from the clean energy generation facility payment by the clean energy generation facility to a host community or the state of new hampshire whether or not required by law or rule and purchase of goods and services by the clean energy generation facility from new hampshire and other domestic sources class i class ii class iii and class iv energy mean those terms as described and defined in rsa f clean energy generation means class i including offshore wind energy generation class ii class iii and class contract means a contract for generation of renewable portfolio standard resource for a period of up to years offshore wind developer means a provider of electricity developed from an offshore wind energy generation project that is located on the outer continental shelf offshore wind energy generation means offshore electric generating resources derived from wind that are class i renewable energy generating sources have a commercial operations date on or after january have been verified by the commission and operate in a designated wind energy area for which an initial federal lease was issued on a competitive basis after january repc means the renewable energy procurement committee established in rsa procurement in order to facilitate the procurement of renewable energy generation and the financing of offshore wind energy generation resources not later than june or a date determined by the governor the renewable energy procurement committee repc shall solicit proposals for offshore wind energy generation and other renewable energy generation resources and provided that reasonable proposals have been received the repc shall select proposals for energy distribution company submission to the commission such submission shall occur following approval of the governor the timetable and method for solicitations of procurement contracts using a competitive bidding process shall be proposed jointly by the distribution companies and repc and upon approval by the governor shall be subject to review and approval by the commission the distribution companies in coordination with the repc shall consult with the attorney general regarding the choice of solicitation methods a solicitation may be coordinated and issued jointly with other new england states within or entities designated by those states the repc and distribution companies may conduct upon approval of the governor one or more competitive solicitations through a staggered procurement schedule developed by the distribution companies and the repc provided that the schedule shall ensure that the distribution companies enter into contracts for offshore wind energy generation and other renewable energy generation sources up to approximately megawatts of aggregate nameplate capacity not later than june and provided further that solicitations in total shall seek proposals for no less than megawatts of aggregate nameplate capacity of offshore wind energy generation resources and associated transmission costs such solicitations may inclusively or separately include other renewable energy sources including class ii class iii and class a staggered procurement schedule may be developed by the rep if the repc in consultation with the distribution companies and the independent evaluator determines that reasonable proposals were not received pursuant to a solicitation the repc may terminate the solicitation and may require additional solicitations to fulfill the requirements of this section a proposed contract shall be subject to the review and approval of the commission as part of its approval process the commission

contract is a mechanism for procuring renewable energy on a basis taking into account the factors outlined in this section a distribution company shall be entitled to cost recovery of payments made under a contract approved under this section in developing proposed contracts the distribution companies shall consider contracts for renewable energy and renewable energy certificates individually and for a combination of both renewable energy certificates and energy a distribution company may decline to pursue a proposal if the proposal s terms and conditions would require the contract obligation to place an unreasonable burden on the distribution company s balance sheet provided however that the distribution company shall take all reasonable actions to structure the contracts

of transmission costs and avoidance of line loss to the extent possible and ensure that transmission cost overruns if any are not borne by ratepayers the distribution companies shall each enter into a contract with the winning bidders for their apportioned share of the market products being purchased from the project the apportioned share shall be calculated and based upon the total default service energy demand from all distribution customers in each service territory of the distribution companies upon the approval of a proposal by the commission the electric distribution company shall have exclusive authority and control over power purchase agreement contracts which shall be completed within days public utilities commission evaluation criteria agreements can be approved if the commission determines that the clean energy resources to be used by a developer under the proposal meet the following criteria a provide adequate energy with enhanced electricity distribution reliability where there is a clear public need including but not limited to a just and reasonable price over the term of the contract b contribute to reducing winter electricity price spikes c are

commission has not notified the distribution company that the renewable energy certificates should be retained to facilitate reaching emission reduction targets pursuant to rsa shall sell the purchased renewable energy certificates to minimize the costs to ratepayers under the contract if a distribution company sells the purchased energy into the wholesale market and sells the renewable
