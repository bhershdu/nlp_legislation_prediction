style="tab-stops:left 18pt left 36pt left 54pt left 72pt left 90pt;"><span class="csDD5E5F52">\t\tVI. &nbsp;Benefits for All Consumers. &nbsp;Restructuring of the electric utility industry should be implemented in a manner that benefits all consumers equitably and does not benefit one customer class to the detriment of another. &nbsp;Costs should not be shifted unfairly among customers. &nbsp;A nonbypassable and competitively neutral system benefits charge applied to the use of the distribution system may be used to fund public benefits related to the provision of electricity. &nbsp;Such benefits, as approved by regulators, may include, but not necessarily be limited to, programs for low-income customers, energy efficiency programs, funding for the electric utility industry&#39;s share of commission </span><span class="cs22FF6315">and department </span><span class="csDD5E5F52">expenses pursuant to RSA 363-A, support for research and development, and investments in commercialization strategies for new and beneficial technologies. &nbsp;Legislative approval of the New Hampshire general court shall be required to increase the system benefits charge. &nbsp;This requirement of prior approval of the New Hampshire general court shall not apply to the energy efficiency portion of the system benefits charge if the increase is authorized by an order of the commission to implement the 3-year planning periods of the Energy Efficiency Resource Standard framework established by commission Order No. 25,932 dated August 2, 2016, ending in 2020 and 2023, or, if for purposes other than implementing the Energy Efficiency Resource Standard, is authorized by the fiscal committee of the general court; provided, however, that no less than 20 percent of the portion of the funds collected for energy efficiency shall be expended on low-income energy efficiency programs. &nbsp;Energy efficiency programs should include the development of relationships with third-party lending institutions to provide opportunities for low-cost financing of energy efficiency measures to leverage available funds to the maximum extent, and shall also include funding for workforce development to minimize waiting periods for low-income energy audits and weatherization.</span></p><p class="csF0A1D375" style="tab-stops:left 18pt left 36pt left 54pt left 72pt left 90pt;"><span class="csDD5E5F52">\t\tVII. &nbsp;Full and Fair Competition. &nbsp;Choice for retail customers cannot exist without a range of viable suppliers. &nbsp;The rules that govern market activity should apply to all buyers and sellers in a fair and consistent manner in order to ensure a fully competitive market. </span></p><p class="csF0A1D375" style="tab-stops:left 18pt left 36pt left 54pt left 72pt left 90pt;"><span class="csDD5E5F52">\t\tVIII. &nbsp;Environmental Improvement. &nbsp;Continued environmental protection and long term environmental sustainability should be encouraged. &nbsp;Increased competition in the electric industry should be implemented in a manner that supports and furthers the goals of environmental improvement. &nbsp;Over time, there should be more equitable treatment of old and new generation sources with regard to air pollution controls and costs. &nbsp;New Hampshire should encourage equitable and appropriate environmental regulation, based on comparable criteria, for all electricity generators, in and out of state, to reduce air pollution transported across state lines and to promote full, free, and fair competition. &nbsp;As generation becomes deregulated, innovative market-driven approaches are preferred to regulatory controls to reduce adverse environmental impacts. &nbsp;Such market approaches may include valuing the costs of pollution and using pollution offset credits. </span></p><p class="csF0A1D375" style="tab-stops:left 18pt left 36pt left 54pt left 72pt left 90pt;"><span class="csDD5E5F52">\t\tIX. &nbsp;Renewable Energy Resources. &nbsp;Increased future commitments to renewable energy resources should be consistent with the New Hampshire energy policy as set forth in RSA 378:37 and should be balanced against the impact on generation prices. &nbsp;Over the long term, increased use of cost-effective renewable energy technologies can have significant environmental, economic, and security benefits. &nbsp;To encourage emerging technologies, restructuring should allow customers the possibility of choosing to pay a premium for electricity from renewable resources and reasonable opportunities to directly invest in and interconnect decentralized renewable electricity generating resources. </span></p><p class="csF0A1D375" style="tab-stops:left 18pt left 36pt left 54pt left 72pt left 90pt;"><span class="csDD5E5F52">\t\tX. &nbsp;Energy Efficiency. &nbsp;Restructuring should be designed to reduce market barriers to investments in energy efficiency and provide incentives for appropriate demand-side management and not reduce cost-effective customer conservation. &nbsp;Utility sponsored energy efficiency programs should target cost-effective opportunities that may otherwise be lost due to market barriers. </span></p><p class="csF0A1D375" style="tab-stops:left 18pt left 36pt left 54pt left 72pt left 90pt;"><span class="csDD5E5F52">\t\tXI. &nbsp;Near Term Rate Relief. &nbsp;The goal of restructuring is to create competitive markets that are expected to produce lower prices for all customers than would have been paid under the current regulatory system. &nbsp;Given New Hampshire&#39;s higher than average regional prices for electricity, utilities, in the near term, should work to reduce rates for all customers. &nbsp;To the greatest extent practicable, rates should approach competitive regional electric rates. &nbsp;The state should recognize when state policies impose costs that conflict with this principle and should take efforts to mitigate those costs. &nbsp;The unique New Hampshire issues contributing to the highest prices in New England should be addressed during the transition, wherever possible. </span></p><p class="csF0A1D375"

to assist it in addressing claims for stranded cost recovery and fulfilling its responsibility to determine rates which are equitable, appropriate, and balanced and in the public interest. &nbsp;In making its determinations, the commission shall balance the interests of ratepayers and utilities during and after the restructuring process. &nbsp;Nothing in this section is intended to provide any greater opportunity for stranded cost recovery than is available under applicable regulation or law on the effective date of this chapter. </span></p><p class="csF0A1D375" style="tab-stops:left 18pt

left 90pt;"><span class="csDD5E5F52">\t\t\t(d) &nbsp;Stranded costs should be determined on a net basis, should be verifiable, should not include transmission and distribution assets, and should be reconciled to actual electricity market conditions from time to time. &nbsp;Any recovery of stranded costs should be through a nonbypassable, nondiscriminatory, appropriately structured charge that is fair to all customer classes, lawful, constitutional, limited in duration, consistent with the promotion of fully competitive markets and consistent with these principles. &nbsp;Entry and exit fees are not preferred recovery mechanisms. &nbsp;Charges to recover stranded costs should only apply to customers within a utility&#39;s retail service territory, except for such costs that have resulted from the provision of wholesale power to another utility. &nbsp;The charges should not apply to wheeling-through transactions. </span></p><p class="csF0A1D375" style="tab-stops:left 18pt left 36pt left 54pt left 72pt left 90pt;"><span class="csDD5E5F52">\t\tXIII. &nbsp;Regionalism. &nbsp;New England Power Pool (NEPOOL) should be reformed and efforts to enhance competition and to complement industry restructuring on a regional basis should be encouraged. &nbsp;New Hampshire should work with other New England and northeastern states to accomplish the goals of restructuring. &nbsp;Working with other regional states, New Hampshire should assert maximum state authority over the entire electric industry restructuring process. &nbsp;While it is desirable to design and implement a restructured industry in concert with the other New England and northeastern states, New Hampshire should not unnecessarily delay its timetable. &nbsp;Any pool structure adopted for the restructured industry should not preclude bilateral contracts with pool and non-pool services and should not preclude ancillary pool services from being obtained from non-pool sources. </span></p><p

</span><span class="csDD5E5F52">administrative processes to make regulation more efficient and to enable competitors to adapt to changes in the market in a timely manner. &nbsp;The market framework for competitive electric service should, to the extent possible, reduce reliance on administrative process. &nbsp;New Hampshire should move deliberately to replace traditional planning mechanisms with market driven choice as the means of supplying resource needs. </span></p><p class="csF0A1D375" style="tab-stops:left 18pt left 36pt left 54pt left 72pt left 90pt;"><span class="csDD5E5F52">\t\tXV. &nbsp;Timetable. &nbsp;The commission should seek to implement full customer choice among electricity suppliers in the most expeditious manner possible, but may delay such implementation in the service territory of any electric utility when implementation would be inconsistent with the goal of near-term rate relief, or would otherwise not be in the public interest. </span></p><p

classes of utilities providing retail electric service under its jurisdiction. &nbsp;The commission shall require such implementation at the earliest date determined to be in the public interest by the commission. &nbsp;However, in no event may the implementation be delayed beyond July 1, 1998 without legislative approval or a finding of public interest by the commission that delay is required due to events beyond the control of the commission or that implementation of retail choice within the service territory of any electric utility would be inconsistent with the goal of near-term rate relief or would otherwise not be in the public interest. &nbsp;In the event that implementation of retail choice is delayed in the service territory of an electric utility, the electric utility shall continue to provide reliable retail service at the lowest reasonable cost in accordance with state law. &nbsp;In addition, at the earliest practical date, the commission should make effective the unbundling of components of rates into at least distribution, transmission, and generation for each jurisdictional utility. </span></p><p class="csF0A1D375" style="tab-stops:left 18pt left 36pt left

set, without a formal rate case proceeding, an interim stranded cost recovery charge for each electric utility. &nbsp;Such interim stranded cost recovery charges shall be effective for not more than 2 years from the implementation of utility compliance filings and shall be based on the commission&#39;s preliminary determination of an equitable, appropriate, and balanced measure of stranded cost recovery that takes into account the near term rate relief principle, is in the public interest, and is substantially consistent with these interdependent principles. &nbsp;The commission shall also consider the potential for future rate impacts due to possible differences between interim stranded cost recovery charges and charges that may finally be approved for stranded cost recovery.

Policy. &nbsp;The purpose of this subdivision is to leverage the purchasing power and economies of scale available to the state when it is acting as purchaser on behalf of state employees and to align this purchasing initiative with a business tax incentive in order to make available to all other public and private employers in the state, on a voluntary basis, advantageously priced family and medical leave insurance (FMLI) wage replacement benefits. &nbsp;By purchasing FMLI coverage for state employees through the medium of commercial insurance, by linking that contract with a contract to make the same coverage available statewide, by acting as premium aggregator for individuals whose employers do not sponsor such coverage, and by introducing a new business tax incentive, the state will position itself to create a market for advantageously priced FMLI benefits. &nbsp;It is the intent of this subdivision to significantly increase the number of employees in the state who receive FMLI wage replacement benefits. &nbsp;The social benefits of increasing the rate of FMLI coverage include attracting and retaining workers, including younger workers, to the state, enabling parents to bond with biological, adopted, or foster children, helping to meet the needs of an aging population, promoting workplace stability, and enhancing worker retention and productivity. &nbsp;While many larger employers provide paid FMLI benefits through self-insurance, this is not feasible for most mid-sized and smaller businesses. &nbsp;The general court therefore finds that it is in the public interest for the state to strategically use its purchasing power and tax expenditure authority to establish a marketplace in the state for advantageously priced FMLI wage replacement benefits.</span></p><p class="csF0A1D375" style="tab-stops:left 18pt left 36pt left 54pt left 72pt left 90pt;"><span class="csDD5E5F52">\t21-I:98 &nbsp;Definitions. &nbsp;In this
