transmission costs are allocated to reduce the retail load measured at the point of interconnection between the distribution system under state jurisdiction and transmission facilities under federal jurisdiction. &nbsp;Said costs shall be allocated to the distribution utility as transmission network customer are reduced from what they otherwise would be absent the electricity exported to the

at the monthly hour of coincident peak demand on which the applicable monthly transmission charges are incurred in proportion to the utility&rsquo;s applicable total network load. &nbsp;In such an event, the customers within such LSE&rsquo;s metering subdomain shall no longer be subject to the distribution utility&rsquo;s transmission charges, after accounting for any prior period over or under collection of transmission costs, such that there is an equitable allocation of transmission costs accounting for applicable leads and lags in how such costs are incurred and paid for as determined by

line and transformation losses in the distribution and transmission grids to provide some sharing of the benefit of reduced transmission charges with other ratepayers who do not participate in such intrastate electricity sales by limited producers. &nbsp;In such an event, the customers within such LSE&rsquo;s metering subdomain shall continue to the pay the utility&rsquo;s regular transmission

exporting power to distribution grid at the annual hour of coincident peak demand on which capacity supply obligations are incurred for any given capacity commitment period and such exports reduce overall capacity supply obligations from what they would otherwise be absent such exports to the grid, such reduced capacity supply obligations shall be assigned to the LSE serving such limited producers as approved by the commission. &nbsp;To the extent such exports to the grid are purchased by the LSE as an intrastate wholesale transaction the LSE may in turn prorate its reduced capacity supply obligation attributable to such exports to reduce the capacity tags for all meters served by it within its applicable meter subdomain at the time of the annual coincident peak demand for the applicable capacity commitment period. &nbsp;To the extent such exports to the grid are sold by the Limited Producer at retail to individual customers such reduced capacity supply obligations attributable to such exports may be assigned to reduce the capacity tags assigned to the meters of such customers, as determined by the LSE serving such customers at the time of the applicable annual hour of coincident peak demand for the applicable capacity commitment period. &nbsp;However, in no case shall the capacity tag assigned to any one retail meter, including that of the limited producer, be reduced below zero. </span></p><p class="csF0A1D375" style="tab-stops:left 18pt left 36pt left 54pt left 72pt left 90pt;"><span class="csDD5E5F52">\t4 &nbsp;New Section; Electric Renewable
