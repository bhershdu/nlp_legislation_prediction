submit to the secretary of agriculture in conformity with the provisions of said soil conservation and domestic allotment act a state plan for each year it shall be the purpose of each such plan and each such plan shall be designed to promote such utilization of land and such farming practices as the department finds will tend in conjunction with the operation of such other plans as may be approved for other states by the secretary of agriculture to preserve and improve soil fertility and soil health to promote adaptation to changes in climate and environment to promote the economic use and conservation of land to diminish exploitation and wasteful and unscientific use of natural soil resources to protect rivers and waterways against the results of soil erosion and aid in flood control and to reestablish and maintain the ratio between the purchasing power of the net income per person on farms and that of the income per person not on farms as defined in subsection a of section of the soil conservation and domestic allotment act each such plan shall provide for adjustments in utilization of land and in farming practices through agreements with producers or through other voluntary methods and for benefit payments in connection therewith and for such methods of administration not in conflict with any law of the state and for such reports as the secretary of agriculture finds necessary for the effective administration of the plan and for ascertaining whether the plan is being carried out according to its terms declaration of policy conservation districts soil conservation amend rsa to read as follows declaration of policy it is hereby declared to be the policy of the state to provide for the establishment of conservation districts under the supervision of a state conservation committee said districts to be composed of landowners and land occupiers within the district who may join together in the interest of the health conservation and development of the soil water and related natural resources and preventing soil erosion floodwater and sediment damages promoting soil health practices drought resilience and adaption to changes in climate and environment it is the intent of this subdivision to facilitate the joint effort of landowners land occupiers and units of government in carrying out measures for the conservation and development of lands within the district voluntarily and with such assistance as may be available for this purpose from local state or federal governmental agencies soil conservation conservation

animals and humans healthy soils practices mean agricultural practices that improve the health of soils including but not limited to consideration of depth of topsoil horizons water infiltration rate organic carbon content nutrient content bulk density biological activity biological and microbiological diversity and minimization of bare ground plant biostimulant means a substance microorganism or mixtures thereof that when applied to seeds plants the rhizosphere soil or other growth media act to support a plant s natural nutrition processes independently of the plant biostimulant s nutrient content improving nutrient availability uptake or use efficiency tolerance to abiotic stress and consequent growth development quality or yield creation of conservation districts soil health amend rsa

proportion of the land occupiers of such districts are in favor of its operation in making such determinations the committee may accept petitions and conduct such public meetings and referenda as it deems necessary and shall give due consideration to the distribution and intensity of erosion floodwaters and sediment damages the effects of drought need for land drainage and changes in land use and the conservation and development of the natural resources the impact of changing climate and environment and capacity of soil health to improve resilience on land within the said district and to other relevant factors from and after the date of adoption by the committee of a resolution in favor of the operation of a particular district such district shall be deemed to be duly organized and the
