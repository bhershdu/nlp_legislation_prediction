In this system, the state establishes minimum standards for public school approval and academic standards for delivery of educational services at the local level.  School districts then have responsibility and flexibility in implementing diverse educational approaches to instruction and curriculum tailored to meet student needs.</span></p><p class="csF0A1D375" style="tab-stops:left 18pt left 36pt left 54pt left 72pt left 90pt;"><span class="csDD5E5F52">\t\tIII. &nbsp;New Hampshire&rsquo;s long history of authorizing local governments, in the form of local school districts, to develop and administer public schools pursuant to a set of minimum standards established by the state has successfully achieved, on average across the state, high quality educational outcomes and high levels of total spending in support of public schools.</span></p><p class="csF0A1D375" style="tab-stops:left 18pt left 36pt left 54pt left 72pt left 90pt;"><span class="csDD5E5F52">\t\tIV. &nbsp;While prior New Hampshire legislative efforts to define and measure the adequacy of public education have relied on input-based methods to set basic education funding levels, the general court finds that defining the concept of adequate education in terms of outcomes and performance provides a more precise and actionable approach that will better identify areas of greatest need for supports.</span></p><p class="csF0A1D375" style="tab-stops:left 18pt left 36pt left 54pt left 72pt left 90pt;"><span class="csDD5E5F52">\t\tV. &nbsp;Data demonstrates a strong relationship between measures of poverty such as percentage of students eligible to receive free and reduced price lunches and student outcomes.

The general court finds there is a strong relationship between measures of student poverty such as percentage of students eligible to receive receiving free and reduced lunches and total spending (including both state and local funding sources).  For example, school districts that have higher percentages of students receiving free and reduced lunches also have lower total spending.</span></p><p class="csF0A1D375" style="tab-stops:left 18pt left 36pt left 54pt left 72pt left 90pt;"><span class="csDD5E5F52">\t\tVII. &nbsp;The general court makes the ultimate finding that, consistent with academic research and data and based on the above findings, the concept of what constitutes a constitutionally adequate education should be defined in terms of opportunity to achieve a desired level of outcomes for all students in the state regardless of where they live.</span></p><p class="csF0A1D375" style="tab-stops:left 18pt left 36pt left 54pt left 72pt left 90pt;"><span class="csDD5E5F52">\t\tVIII. &nbsp;The general court further makes the ultimate finding that, consistent with academic research and data and based on the above findings, the value of ensuring a constitutionally adequate education throughout the state should be measured by the total funding projected to provide an equal opportunity to achieve the defined statewide target desired level of outcome, regardless of where students live.</span></p><p class="csF0A1D375" style="tab-stops:left 18pt left 36pt left 54pt left 72pt left 90pt;"><span class="csDD5E5F52">\t\tIX. &nbsp;The general court further makes the ultimate finding that use of the definition of adequacy that is framed in terms of targeted outcomes will facilitate a system of public school funding that allocates funding from state sources to those communities with the greatest need and lowest capacities, in order to ensure that the state provides all children with an opportunity for a constitutionally adequate education, regardless of where they live.</span></p><p class="csF0A1D375" style="tab-stops:left 18pt left 36pt left 54pt left 72pt left 90pt;"><span class="csDD5E5F52">\t\tX. &nbsp;The general court further makes the ultimate finding that, while principles of equity supporting student equity require the establishment of the foundation opportunity method of determining state public education grants in this act, in order to protect municipalities from adverse impacts on students that could result from immediate implementation of such method, there should be provisions that transition from the current system to the new system, including transition grants designed to hold harmless current grant levels for all municipalities.</span></p><p class="csF0A1D375" style="tab-stops:left 18pt left 36pt left 54pt left 72pt left 90pt;"><span class="csDD5E5F52">\t</span><a name="Chapt12"></a><span class="csDD5E5F52">2 &nbsp;Definition of Adequate Education. &nbsp;RSA 193-E:2-a is repealed and reenacted to read as follows:</span></p><p class="csF0A1D375" style="tab-stops:left 18pt left 36pt left 54pt left 72pt left 90pt;"><span class="csDD5E5F52">\t193-E:2-a  Definition of a Constitutionally Adequate Education;
