Enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives in General Court convened:</span></p><p class="csD15247B9"><span class="csDD5E5F52">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csF0A1D375" style="tab-stops:left 18pt left 36pt left 54pt left 72pt left 90pt;"><span class="csDD5E5F52">\t</span><a name="Chapt5"></a><span class="csDD5E5F52">1 &nbsp;Findings. &nbsp;The general court finds and declares the following principles:</span></p><p class="csF0A1D375" style="tab-stops:left 18pt left 36pt left 54pt left 72pt left 90pt;"><span class="csDD5E5F52">\t\tI. &nbsp;The principle of freedom of speech has from the earliest days of this state been regarded as a fundamental tenet of the existence and operation of all public colleges and universities in New Hampshire.</span></p><p class="csF0A1D375" style="tab-stops:left 18pt left 36pt left 54pt left 72pt left 90pt;"><span class="csDD5E5F52">\t\tII. &nbsp;Students should have freedom to discuss any problem that presents itself. &nbsp;The response to ideas some may oppose is through open discussion rather than through inhibition. &nbsp;Free inquiry is indispensable to the good life, public colleges and universities exist for the sake of such inquiry.</span></p><p class="csF0A1D375" style="tab-stops:left 18pt left 36pt left 54pt left 72pt left 90pt;"><span class="csDD5E5F52">\t\tIII. &nbsp;The commitment to free and open inquiry is the hallmark of higher education. &nbsp;Public postsecondary educational institutions guarantee that all members of its community retain the broadest possible latitude to speak, write, listen, challenge, and learn is what distinguishes higher education. &nbsp;Except insofar as limitations on that freedom are necessary to the functioning of the institution, public postsecondary educational institutions should fully respect and support the freedom of all members of its community to discuss any problem that presents itself.</span></p><p class="csF0A1D375" style="tab-stops:left 18pt left 36pt left 54pt left 72pt left 90pt;"><span class="csDD5E5F52">\t\tIV. &nbsp;The ideas of different members of public postsecondary educational institutional communities will often and quite naturally conflict. &nbsp;But it is not the proper role of public postsecondary educational institutions to attempt to shield individuals from ideas and opinions they find unwelcome, disagreeable, or even deeply offensive. &nbsp;Although public postsecondary educational institutions greatly value civility, and although all members of its community should share in the responsibility for maintaining a climate of mutual respect, concerns about civility and mutual respect should never be used as a justification for closing off discussion of ideas, however offensive or disagreeable those ideas may be to some members of its community.</span></p><p class="csF0A1D375" style="tab-stops:left 18pt left 36pt left 54pt left 72pt left 90pt;"><span class="csDD5E5F52">\t\tV.\tThe general court hereby declares public postsecondary educational institutions shall commit and follow the principles found in the First Amendment to the United States Constitution and Part I, Article 22 of the New Hampshire constitution. &nbsp;That shall be done through this act.</span></p><p class="csF0A1D375" style="tab-stops:left 18pt left 36pt left 54pt left 72pt left 90pt;"><span class="csDD5E5F52">\t</span><a
