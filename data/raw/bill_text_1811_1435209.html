temporary health partners following no less than 8 hours of training provided either by a national association or a New Hampshire educational program. &nbsp;As a matter of public policy, the general

requires the licensure of individuals engaged in music therapy beginning July 1, 2021 and establishes a 5 member governing board within the office of allied health professionals. &nbsp;The bill establishes a new classified position of program assistant II (labor grade 15) to assist the board in its duties. &nbsp;The bill appropriates funds for the salary and benefits of the position and for the per diem and mileage expenses of board members from the Office of Professional Licensure and Certification Fund (OPLC) established in RSA 310-A:1-e. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs9E885863"><span class="csDD5E5F52">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs9E885863"><span class="csDD5E5F52">The OPLC estimates the salary and benefits for the new full-time position to cost $60,000 in FY22, $63,000 in FY23 and $66,000 in FY24.</span></p><p class="cs9E885863"><span class="csDD5E5F52">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs9E885863"><span class="csDD5E5F52">&nbsp;The OPLC estimates the 5 member board would meet 12 times per year, with expenses for annual per diem and mileage totaling $5,460 per year, as shown below:</span></p><p class="cs9E885863"><span class="csDD5E5F52">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs2AF3720A"><span class="csDD5E5F52">5 members x 12 meetings x $50 per diem = $3,000</span></p><p class="cs2AF3720A"><span class="csDD5E5F52">5 members x 12 meetings x $41 average mileage

licenses would be granted. &nbsp;Such licenses would be renewed every 2 years and all allied health initial licenses are currently set at $110 payable biennially. &nbsp;This amount would generate $22,000 in license revenue every 2 years ($110 x 200 = $22,000).</span></p><p class="cs9E885863"><span class="csDD5E5F52">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs9E885863"><span class="csDD5E5F52">The bill prohibits the practice of &nbsp;music therapy without a license but there is no penalty. &nbsp;The addition of this license category also subjects licensees to the allied health criminal records check provision pursuant to RSA 328-F:18-a and performed by the Department of Safety. &nbsp;The $25 fee associated with such checks is payable by the license applicant. &nbsp;Based on the OPLC estimate of 200 applicants, potential &nbsp;initial revenue of $5,000 would be generated for the Criminal Records Check Fund pursuant to RSA 106-B:7, II, with an indeterminable amount thereafter based on an unknown number of new applicants.</span></p><p class="cs9E885863"><span class="csDD5E5F52">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csF0A1D375"><span class="cs5925EB86">AGENCIES CONTACTED:</span></p><p
