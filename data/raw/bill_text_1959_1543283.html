class="csF2A08AB2"><span class="csDD5E5F52">Amends the existing voluntary training provisions applicable to new planning or zoning board members by allowing all planning and zoning board members to receive training from the Department of Business and Economic Affairs, Office of Planning and Development (OPD) free of charge. &nbsp;OPD training may be designed in a variety of formats, including web-based, distance learning or traditional classroom style. </span></li><li class="csF2A08AB2"><span class="csDD5E5F52">Modifies the appeals process for zoning decisions and process for fees for posting of bonds. </span></li><li class="csF2A08AB2"><span class="csDD5E5F52">Makes numerous changes to enhance the availability of workforce and available housing, including: </span><ul style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">\r\n\t\t\t\t<li class="cs72C1F9B0"><span class="csDD5E5F52">Authorizes municipalities to establish municipal economic development and revitalization districts under RSA 162-K, also known as TIF (Tax Increment Financing), to construct workforce housing or generally increase the available housing stock.</span></li><li class="cs72C1F9B0"><span class="csDD5E5F52">Extends the maximum duration of the community revitalization tax relief incentive period under RSA 79-E for certain housing projects, based on type of project. </span></li><li class="cs72C1F9B0"><span class="csDD5E5F52">Establishes a voluntary housing champion certification program for qualifying municipalities to promote the development of workforce housing and other types of housing necessary for the economic development of the state. &nbsp;Certification is valid for 3 years and may be renewed for another 3 year period. &nbsp;The program is to be administered by the OPD. &nbsp;Municipalities would be eligible for preferential access to state resources such as discretionary state infrastructure funds.</span></li></ul>\r\n\t\t\t</li></ul>\r\n\t\t<p

training for planning and zoning board members could be interpreted broadly for the provision of course materials and reasonable access to training and tests statewide, resulting in an indeterminable fiscal impact on the agency&#39;s expenditures. </span></p><p class="cs6A0709A4"><span class="csDD5E5F52">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs6A0709A4"><span class="csDD5E5F52">The OPD also states the proposed housing champion certification program for municipalities is to be administered by the office, but the uncertain nature of a voluntary program and its cyclical nature makes it difficult to reliably anticipate associated staffing needs. &nbsp;The additional responsibilities involved in adopting rules, establishing program qualifications, consulting with relevant state agencies and entities to avoid conflicts and providing an annual report and overall program impact and assessment of additional housing units produced is beyond the office&#39;s current scope of work, necessitating an indeterminable increase in state expenditures to fulfill these requirements.</span></p><p class="cs6A0709A4"><span class="csDD5E5F52">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs6A0709A4"><span class="csDD5E5F52">The New Hampshire Municipal Association (NHMA) indicates municipalities may utilize the provisions of RSA 162-K and RSA 79-E and may experience a shift in property tax revenues, without necessarily increasing or decreasing such revenues. &nbsp;Results would vary on a town by town basis. &nbsp;A municipality that qualifies as a housing champion may receive additional revenues associated with state infrastructure funding awards, but such amounts are unknown. NHMA also states other provisions of the bill may negatively impact municipal expenditures, but due to the unknown number or extent of such occurrences, such impact is indeterminable. These provisions relate to the posting of a bond if a municipality appeals a land use board decision if ordered by a court, and the awarding of attorney fees if a land use board decision is reversed on appeal and such board acted with gross negligence, in bad faith or with malice. Municipal revenue may increase if a land use board decision is upheld on appeal and the appealing party acted in bad faith or with malice and attorney fees are awarded. &nbsp;Due to the unknown frequency of such an event the fiscal impact on municipal revenue is indeterminable. The other provisions of the bill are unlikely to affect municipal revenue or expenditures.</span></p><p class="cs6A0709A4"><span class="csDD5E5F52">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs6A0709A4"><span class="csDD5E5F52">The Department of Revenue Administration indicates that a municipality that adopts RSA 162- K may experience an indeterminable revenue and expenditure impact based on the details of such tax increment financing and project expenses. &nbsp;A municipality that adopts RSA 79-E and grants tax relief under the expanded duration periods will experience a redistribution of the overall tax burden but no drop in total revenue. &nbsp;The Department cannot project any impact on municipal expenditures associated with the changes to this provision. </span></p><p class="cs6A0709A4"><span class="csDD5E5F52">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs6A0709A4"><span class="csDD5E5F52">The Judicial Branch states there are a number of existing laws, in addition to Constitutional requirements, that require expedited review or have deadlines by which a decision is required.
