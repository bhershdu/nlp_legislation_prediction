governing the Department of Health and Human Services. &nbsp;Those changes, and their potential fiscal impacts, are as follows:</span></p><p class="cs9E885863"><span class="csDD5E5F52">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs9E885863"><span class="csDD5E5F52">Sections 1 and 2 establish a special fund for administration of opioid treatment programs. &nbsp;The non-lapsing, dedicated fund would be used to support program operations for certification and administration of oversight of opioid treatment programs. &nbsp;The Department anticipates an indeterminable increase in expenditures to support program operations.</span></p><p class="cs9E885863"><span class="csDD5E5F52">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs9E885863"><span class="csDD5E5F52">Section 3 relates to implementing a pilot program to serve up to 20 individuals, between the ages of 18-21, who are enrolled in school and determined eligible for developmental services that are not the responsibility of the local education agency, another state agency, or another division of the Department. &nbsp;The bill contains a $2.8 million general fund appropriation for the purposes of implementing the pilot program. &nbsp;Given that the pilot program limits the number of participants, the Department expects that federal financial participation may not be available through the section 1915(c) home and community based services waiver. &nbsp;The proposed amendment to RSA 171-A:1-a, II clarifies that the Department cannot provide services for persons eligible if funding has not been allocated in accordance with paragraph I. </span></p><p class="cs9E885863"><span class="csDD5E5F52">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs9E885863"><span class="csDD5E5F52">Section 4 amends RSA 167:17-a to add &ldquo;failure to report collateral resources&rdquo; as an element authorizing recovery by the Department for overpayment, clarify the Department&rsquo;s ability to recover overpayments in circumstances of agency error, and stipulate that any individual who assists a recipient in receiving an overpayment is jointly and severally liable for the overpayment. &nbsp;The Department expects an indeterminable increase in recovery of overpayments of certain cash public assistance as a result of this section.</span></p><p class="cs9E885863"><span class="csDD5E5F52">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs9E885863"><span class="csDD5E5F52">Sections 5 and 6 are based on the Department&rsquo;s ongoing inventory and review of departmental reporting requirements. &nbsp;&nbsp;The fiscal impact is expected to be minimal. </span></p><p class="cs9E885863"><span class="csDD5E5F52">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs9E885863"><span class="csDD5E5F52">Sections 7 and 8 amend RSA 169-C, the child protection act, to allow alternative service of process when a parent cannot be located. &nbsp;This Department states that this change is consistent with the guardianship statute and will promote permanency in cases where a parent cannot be served at their abode or in-hand. &nbsp;&nbsp;The Department anticipates minimal fiscal impact.</span></p><p class="cs9E885863"><span class="csDD5E5F52">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs9E885863"><span class="csDD5E5F52">Sections 9-14 amend the foster care licensing statute, RSA 170-E, to define kinship and create a separate category of foster license for kinship caregivers who are only seeking to provide care to children with whom they have an existing relationship. &nbsp;The Department states that this change is consistent with a desire to place children with family and fictive kin, and will allow the Department to provide better support to child specific caregivers and in turn expand the options for placement and address the shortage of available foster homes. &nbsp;The Department expects the fiscal impact to be minimal. </span></p><p class="csF0A1D375"><span class="csDD5E5F52">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs9E885863"><span class="csDD5E5F52">Sections 15 and 16 amend RSA 167:6 to eliminate the requirement that the Department charge premiums for the Medicaid for Employed Adults with Disabilities (MEAD) and Medicaid for Older Adults with Disabilities (MOAD) coverage groups. &nbsp;The Department anticipates a minimal fiscal impact due to the offset between lost premium revenue and decreased cost of administration.</span></p><p class="cs9E885863"><span class="csDD5E5F52">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs9E885863"><span class="csDD5E5F52">Sections 17 through 21 amend certain domestic relations statutes and guardianship statutes to provide the Department a meaningful opportunity to inform courts of concerns relative to the impact of spousal support and guardianship orders on individuals who are Medicaid recipients or who may be suspected victims of abuse, neglect or exploitation. &nbsp;These sections are expected to result in a minimal fiscal impact to the Department.</span></p><p class="cs9E885863"><span class="csDD5E5F52">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs9E885863"><span class="csDD5E5F52">Section 22 allows family caregivers or legally responsible individuals to be paid as personal care attendants for Medicaid recipients in lieu of up to 50% portion of unfilled private duty nursing hours. &nbsp;This provision would only be utilized if the 1135 federal waiver ended, and another means of coverage through CMS was not readily attainable. &nbsp;This section would remain temporarily in effect for no longer than two years. &nbsp;The bill contains a $700,000 general fund appropriation in FY23 for the purposes of this section.</span></p><p class="cs9E885863"><span class="csDD5E5F52">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs9E885863"><span class="csDD5E5F52">Section 23 removes the requirement in RSA 130-A:5, I for the necessity for two venous blood tests to determine a blood lead level related investigations of the cases of lead poisoning in children. &nbsp;It also would remove the declaration requirement by a physician after receiving the lead test results from the laboratory. &nbsp;Also removed is the declaration from a physician that the results of the first venous blood test, which per the current statute would be the only way a second test would not be required. &nbsp;The Department anticipates minimal fiscal impact as a result of this section.</span></p><p class="cs9E885863"><span class="csDD5E5F52">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs9E885863"><span class="csDD5E5F52">Section 24 clarifies the food services licensure exemption for recreational camps. &nbsp;The Department anticipates no fiscal impact.</span></p><p class="cs9E885863"><span class="csDD5E5F52">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs9E885863"><span class="csDD5E5F52">Section 25 aligns legal and working titles for unclassified positions within the department, and the Department anticipates no fiscal impact.</span></p><p class="cs9E885863"><span class="csDD5E5F52">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs9E885863"><span class="csDD5E5F52">Section 26 is responsive to a recent financial audit regarding recovery forgiveness of shift differential paid to certain clinical staff at NHH and Glencliff Home. &nbsp;The bill contains a &nbsp;$29,000 general fund appropriation in FY23 to implement this section.</span></p><p class="cs9E885863"><span class="csDD5E5F52">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs9E885863"><span class="csDD5E5F52">Section 27 establishes six new unclassified leadership positions within the department of health and human services to assist with the strategic direction and oversight of day to day operations of Hampstead Hospital. &nbsp;The bill does not identify specific labor grades or position titles, but does state that six existing non-classified positions established for the same purposes shall be transfered to the newly-created unclassified positions. &nbsp;Once completed, the non-classified positions shall be eliminated. &nbsp;The fiscal impact is indeterminable. </span></p><p class="cs9E885863"><span class="csDD5E5F52">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs9E885863"><span class="csDD5E5F52">Section 28 provides statutory authority for a salary adjustment for the purposes of recruitment or retention of certain classified clinical staff such as nurses and other critical, clinical staff in light of hiring shortages. &nbsp;This authority is similar to that already granted for certain unclassified positions. &nbsp;The fiscal impact is indeterminable. </span></p><p class="cs9E885863"><span class="csDD5E5F52">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs9E885863"><span class="csDD5E5F52">Sections 29-51 remove all references to the Anna Philbrick center and the Laconia State School from New Hampshire revised statutes annotated. &nbsp;The Department anticipates no fiscal impact as a result of these sections.</span></p><p class="cs9E885863"><span class="csDD5E5F52">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs9E885863"><span class="csDD5E5F52">Sections 52 and 53 revise RSA 170-E:7, IV-d and 170-E-29-a, VII (b) to reduce the fee for the employment eligibility card as follows:</span></p><p class="cs9E885863"><span class="csDD5E5F52">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs9E885863"><span class="csE3E0FE0B">The fee for a child care employment or a residential child care employment eligibility card issued shall be [$50] $25 and the card shall be valid for 5 years from the date of issuance, or a prorated amount of [$10] $5 per year from the most recently completed criminal background check. &nbsp;A replacement card may be requested for a [$15] $10 fee.</span></p><p class="cs9E885863"><span class="csDD5E5F52">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs9E885863"><span class="csDD5E5F52">Total fees collected from 2019 through 2021 have ranged from $76,000 to $116,000 annually. &nbsp;The Department projects that as a result of these sections, fee collections will be reduced by approximately one half. </span></p><p class="cs9E885863"><span class="csDD5E5F52">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs9E885863"><span class="csDD5E5F52">Section 54 establishes a new RSA 170-E:42-a, relative to the transfer and discharge of residents in residential care settings. &nbsp;The Department anticipates minimal fiscal impact. </span></p><p class="cs9E885863"><span class="csDD5E5F52">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs9E885863"><span class="csDD5E5F52">Section 55 requires the Department to increase the Medicaid reimbursement rate for facility-based birthing services by 25 percent in the aggregate, and provides a $2.4 million general fund appropriation for this purpose in FY23. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs9E885863"><span class="csDD5E5F52">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs9E885863"><span class="csDD5E5F52">Section 56 allows certain medical professionals to provide telehealth consultations or follow-up care to patients who previously received services from the provider in the state where the provider is licensed. </span></p><p class="cs9E885863"><span class="csDD5E5F52">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs9E885863"><span class="csDD5E5F52">Sections 57-61 remove the criminal background check requirement for designated
