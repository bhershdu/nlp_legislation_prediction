class="cs5925EB86">METHODOLOGY:</span></p><p class="csB74A3FFF"><span class="csDD5E5F52">This bill requires cooperative (and presumably regional) school districts to review and adopt dissolution plans prior to January 1, 2024, and repeals authority for all cooperative school districts on June 30, 2025.  This bill also requires school boards of each cooperative (and regional) school districts shall initiate planning for the dissolution of the cooperative school district by December 31, 2022, and provides steps for the distribution/division of assets to all towns as well as providing steps for sharing the outstanding debt.  The Department of Education is unable to determine this bill&#39;s potential impact on local school district revenue or expenditures, but does state there are 30 regional/cooperative school districts covering 117 towns.  The Department assumes that 27 of these towns, that are part of a 2 school district, would be absorbed by their pre-existing elementary district. &nbsp;This would result in the net gain of 90 new school districts throughout the state. &nbsp;Cost for establishing new districts cannot be determined. &nbsp;In addition to startup cost, school districts would need to budget on an annual basis for administrative cost and district offices.  The Department adds that with the addition of these new districts, programs within the Department may need to budget for new staff to provide technical support.</span></p><p class="csB74A3FFF"><span class="csDD5E5F52">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csF0A1D375"><span class="cs5925EB86">AGENCIES CONTACTED:</span></p><p class="csB74A3FFF"><span class="csDD5E5F52">Department of Education</span></p><p class="csF0A1D375" style="tab-stops:left 18pt left 36pt left 54pt left 72pt left 90pt;"><span class="cs2C11128C">&nbsp;</span></p>'
