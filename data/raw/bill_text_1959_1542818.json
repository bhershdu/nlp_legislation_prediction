the total of all continuing ballots that could possibly be transferred to the candidate in future rounds from candidates with fewer active preferences or an equal number of active preferences would not be enough to surpass the candidate with the next higher active preference total in the round the candidate has a lower active preference total than a candidate described in subparagraph c

difference between such elected candidate s total number of active preferences and the election threshold h exhausted ballot means a ballot that does not rank any continuing candidate contains an overvote at the highest continuing ranking or contains or more sequential skipped rankings before its highest continuing ranking i highest continuing ranking means the highest ranking on a voter s ballot for a continuing candidate j candidate means the candidate with the lowest active preference total in a round of the voting tabulation or any other candidate subject to batch elimination k
