list.</span></p><p class="csF0A1D375" style="tab-stops:left 18pt left 36pt left 54pt left 72pt left 90pt;"><span class="csDD5E5F52">\t\tII. &nbsp;To help ensure a timely and professional response and to promote fairness to individual towing businesses, the division of state police shall maintain a separate rotation list for each state police geographical troop area. &nbsp;In any case where distances involved could cause unreasonably long wrecker responses, the director of state police may authorize a separate rotational list by county or group of communities for that troop. &nbsp;The director may enlarge or shrink an area if necessary to provide a sufficient number of tow businesses to handle the number of calls in the area and the travel distances involved, and shall review the zones periodically to determine if needs are being met.</span></p><p class="csF0A1D375" style="tab-stops:left 18pt left 36pt left 54pt left 72pt left 90pt;"><span class="csDD5E5F52">\t\tIII. &nbsp;If the desired tow business is unable to respond to a call in a timely manner with the proper equipment, the tow business next in line on the rotation list will be called.</span></p><p class="csF0A1D375" style="tab-stops:left 18pt left 36pt left 54pt left 72pt left 90pt;"><span class="csDD5E5F52">\t\tIV. &nbsp;Placement on the tow list shall be by order of application. &nbsp;Whenever a new tow business becomes authorized, it shall be placed on the bottom of the appropriate list or lists for which the director finds the tow business qualified. &nbsp;The director shall have authority to determine when a tow list is adequately staffed with towing businesses and may refuse to add a business to the list if he or she determines the amount and type of calls in that zone is insufficient to justify a larger list. </span></p><p class="csF0A1D375" style="tab-stops:left 18pt left 36pt left 54pt left 72pt left 90pt;"><span class="csDD5E5F52">\t\tV. &nbsp;Separate rotation lists shall be maintained for each category of wrecker. &nbsp;When a situation requires services of a specific category of wrecker, such wrecker shall be called from the appropriate tow list unless the person responsible for the vehicle is present and has a preference for a different tow business with that category of wrecker, in which case the preferred wrecker shall be summoned if available within a reasonable response time.</span></p><p class="csF0A1D375" style="tab-stops:left 18pt left 36pt left 54pt left 72pt left 90pt;"><span class="csDD5E5F52">\t\tVI. &nbsp;Nothing in this chapter shall be

90pt;"><span class="csDD5E5F52">\t\tVII. &nbsp;Calling a tow company from the list does not create a contract with or obligation on the part of the state police or state police personnel to reimburse any fee or towing charge, except when towing a vehicle owned or leased by the state police or that is later forfeited to the state police, or if a court determines that the state police wrongfully authorized the tow and orders the state police to pay transportation and storage fees.</span></p><p class="csF0A1D375" style="tab-stops:left 18pt left 36pt left 54pt left 72pt left 90pt;"><span

consequence of not being called in accordance with the list, or when removed from the rotation list. &nbsp;If a towing business responds to a state police call and the call is later canceled due to the vehicle no longer being disabled, or the circumstances change such that after calling a tow company the vehicle must be stored in a manner that preserves all evidence in or on the vehicle and the tow business is not so equipped, the tow business shall go back to the top of the list.</span></p><p class="csF0A1D375" style="tab-stops:left 18pt left 36pt left 54pt left 72pt left 90pt;"><span class="csDD5E5F52">\t\tIX. &nbsp;A tow business shall, upon receiving a request from the state police, use its own equipment and shall not refer a call to another tow business. &nbsp;</span></p><p

service provider and be removed from the rotation list by providing prompt written notice to state police communications. &nbsp;In the event of unforeseen circumstances such as death, fire, bankruptcy, or loss of equipment from accident or failure, a tow business on the tow list shall timely notify the director of state police in writing of its intent to suspend its designation as a service provider. &nbsp;If and when it desires to return to service, such tow company shall send a new application to the director. &nbsp;If approved to resume operation, they shall be placed at the bottom of the rotation list.</span></p><p class="csF0A1D375" style="tab-stops:left 18pt left 36pt left 54pt left 72pt left 90pt;"><span class="csDD5E5F52">\t\tXI. &nbsp;New tow businesses, when

motorcycles.</span></p><p class="csF0A1D375" style="tab-stops:left 18pt left 36pt left 54pt left 72pt left 90pt;"><span class="csDD5E5F52">\t\tXIV. &nbsp;The division shall not call a tow business that, in its opinion, does not have a vehicle of sufficient size and equipment for a specific job. &nbsp;Under these conditions, the tow business not called will remain on the top of the rotation list.</span></p><p class="csF0A1D375" style="tab-stops:left 18pt left 36pt left 54pt left 72pt left 90pt;"><span class="csDD5E5F52">\t\tXV. &nbsp;A tow business shall not sell, assign, transfer, pledge, surrender, encumber, or dispose of its place on the rotation list. &nbsp;By applying to be placed on the list, a tow business agrees to respond to all state police calls 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. &nbsp;If for any reason the business cannot respond to a call, it rotates to the bottom of the list. &nbsp;Businesses that develop a pattern of non-response to calls may be subject to removal from the rotation list.</span></p><p class="csF0A1D375" style="tab-stops:left 18pt left 36pt left 54pt left 72pt left 90pt;"><span class="csDD5E5F52">\t\tXVI. &nbsp;A tow business shall appear on the rotation list only once. &nbsp;The listing shall use the name of the business submitted at the time of application and a designation for any specialty in which the business is qualified. &nbsp;A tow business conducting business at a location shall not receive multiple listings or classifications by utilizing a different or fictitious name for trucks operating from the same location or trucks operating with the same name out of different locations within that zone.</span></p><p class="csF0A1D375" style="tab-stops:left 18pt left 36pt left 54pt left 72pt left 90pt;"><span class="csDD5E5F52">\t\tXVII. &nbsp;When emergency conditions necessitate, the state police may request the services of the tow business that is best equipped to handle the emergency and can reach the scene in the shortest time, regardless of its position on the rotation list. &nbsp;A call made under these circumstances shall count as such business&#39;s next rotation call.</span></p><p class="csF0A1D375" style="tab-stops:left 18pt left 36pt left 54pt left 72pt left 90pt;"><span class="csDD5E5F52">\t\tXVIII. &nbsp;Whenever heavy equipment or large vehicles are involved in an incident, and it is determined that the tow business next up on the rotation list lacks adequate equipment to handle the incident, the division may call a larger piece of equipment from a business on the list that can handle the situation. &nbsp;In such case, the tow business shall be repositioned on the rotation list accordingly. &nbsp;Having only one large rotation wrecker shall not justify for being called to all truck accidents.</span></p><p class="csF0A1D375" style="tab-stops:left 18pt left 36pt left 54pt left 72pt left 90pt;"><span class="csDD5E5F52">\t\tXIX. &nbsp;In the event of an overturned truck, the state police shall determine at the time if the situation requires the use of only one tow business or if additional vehicles are required. &nbsp;The first named tow business shall determine the amount of assistance necessary to remove any public hazards. &nbsp;The tow business responding to the law enforcement request shall be responsible for contacting others meeting the qualifications to operate in New Hampshire and shall be the business responsible for efficient and safe handling of the recovery. &nbsp;Decisions made pursuant to this paragraph shall be based on the public safety concerns.</span></p><p class="csF0A1D375" style="tab-stops:left 18pt left 36pt left 54pt left 72pt left 90pt;"><span class="csDD5E5F52">\t\tXX. &nbsp;At no time shall any towing vehicle

the trooper in charge at the scene a valid reason for the delay within that time, a second rotation wrecker may be dispatched. &nbsp;If a second wrecker is requested before the arrival of the

Trust Settlement or by federal or other competitively awarded funds installed after January 1, 2022 to be equipped for universal access.</span></li><li class="csA84BF7FB"><span class="csDD5E5F52">Allows municipalities with populations greater than 50,000 to expand the use motor vehicle permit fees collected pursuant to RSA 261:154 &nbsp;to fund the construction, operation and maintenance of EVSE.</span></li><li class="csA84BF7FB"><span class="csDD5E5F52">Establishes a $20 registration fee on all electric and hybrid vehicles to fund the construction of EVSE on state highways and turnpikes.</span></li><li class="csA84BF7FB"><span class="csDD5E5F52">Authorizes municipalities to provide property tax relief under RSA 79-E on the value of &nbsp;EVSE installed in residential homes and rental properties, businesses, and industries.</span></li><li class="csA84BF7FB"><span class="csDD5E5F52">Amends the definitions of the terms &quot;light duty truck&quot;, &quot;passenger vehicle&quot; and &quot;motor vehicle&quot; as applied to the state&#39;s motor vehicle fleet.</span></li><li class="csA84BF7FB"><span class="csDD5E5F52">Requires the Department of Administrative Services to establish procedures to convert the state&#39;s vehicle fleet of light duty trucks and passenger vehicles to (Zero Emission Vehicles) ZEVs by 2042. &nbsp;Requires that by 2026, all new leases or purchases of light duty trucks or passenger vehicles shall be ZEVs and by 2032 any new leases or purchase of trucks and other vehicles in excess for 10,000 pounds in weight shall be ZEVs. &nbsp;Transition plans shall be developed by all state agencies and departments for submission to the Office of Strategic Initiatives by June 30, 2022 and revised and submitted every 2 years thereafter until all of the state&#39;s motor vehicles are ZEVs.</span></li><li class="csA84BF7FB"><span class="csDD5E5F52">Establishes electric vehicle charging station rate design

the recommendations of the Electric Vehicle Charging Stations Infrastructure Commission include actions relating to the development of electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE); the use of the Volkswagen settlement&rsquo;s New Hampshire Volkswagen Beneficiary Mitigation Trust (NH VW Trust) for such development; the sale of electric vehicles (EVs) in New Hampshire; the adoption of EVs by state agencies; participation in regional programs aimed at increasing adoption of EVs; investment by regulated utilities to support EVSE installations; adoption of building codes to encourage EVSE installation; and other measures will result in some level of unknown expense for state agencies. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs9E885863"><span class="csDD5E5F52">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs9E885863"><span class="csDD5E5F52">DES states the rebate program using the NH VW Trust funds could utilize up to 15% of the project cost for administrative expense with no expected impact on general funds. &nbsp;The Trust Fund has a maximum allowable funding for support of EVSE but the impact on this fund from this provision is indeterminable..</span></p><p class="cs9E885863"><span class="csDD5E5F52">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs9E885863"><span class="csDD5E5F52">DES projects the additional $20 registration fee on 4,713 electric vehicles (EVs) including plug-in hybrids, registered in New Hampshire as of January 1, 2021, would yield approximately $94,260 in additional revenue. &nbsp;The number of EVs is expected to increase over time.</span></p><p class="cs9E885863"><span class="csDD5E5F52">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs9E885863"><span class="csDD5E5F52">DES also notes the cost to transition the state vehicle fleet to ZEVs over time is required to be performed &quot;to the extent feasible, practicable and cost effective.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs9E885863"><span class="csDD5E5F52">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs9E885863"><span class="csDD5E5F52">The Office of Strategic Initiatives states the recommendations of the Electric Vehicle Charging Station Infrastructure Commission includes actions relating to the development of EVSE and the use of the NH VW Trust funds for such development. &nbsp;The NH VW Trust may only be spent as allowed by the terms of the Trust and would have no impact on general funds. &nbsp;The impact to the Trust is indeterminable.</span></p><p class="cs9E885863"><span class="csDD5E5F52">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs9E885863"><span class="csDD5E5F52">The Department of Justice provides some assistance to the Office of Strategic Initiatives in its administration of the NH VW Trust but DOJ states there may only be a slight increase in necessary assistance resulting from this section. &nbsp;Since any such assistance would be negligible and would be accomplished within the current budget, there is no fiscal impact on the Department. </span></p><p class="cs9E885863"><span class="csDD5E5F52">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs9E885863"><span class="csDD5E5F52">The Department of Administrative Services assumes the requirement to convert the state fleet to ZEVs does not apply to heavy construction equipment, ATVs, snowmobiles, boats or other equipment not used primarily on roads and highways. &nbsp;The department also assumes most new ZEVs will be electric vehicles. &nbsp;Capital expenditures would increase beginning in FY 2023 with new EV sites and the first agency EV purchases and leases would begin in FY 2024. &nbsp;The department expects incremental costs to replace existing vehicles, EV charging site development costs and maintenance and training costs for state agency personnel. &nbsp;More frequent upgrades of vehicles and equipment are also anticipated. &nbsp;The department estimates it will cost the state $46.3 million to replace the entire state fleet with ZEVs. The department estimates charging site development and infrastructure at 50 locations would cost between $4.5 million-$14.5 million for Level 2 Public Advanced Technology Chargers and between $6.9 million-$20.5 million for Level 3 DC Fast Chargers.</span></p><p class="cs9E885863"><span class="csDD5E5F52">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs9E885863"><span class="csDD5E5F52">The Department of Safety states the current vehicle counts for electric (3,102) and plug-in electric vehicles (543) at $20 per vehicle would yield $72,900 per year or $36,450 for FY 2022 with an effective date of January 1, 2022. &nbsp;The Department estimates a state expenditure of $540,000 in FY 2022 for the programming of the vehicle registration system (MAAP) and reprogramming of the VIN decoder. &nbsp;State highway expenditures would increase beginning in FY 2023 pursuant to RSA 235:23 which requires 12% of the gross road toll revenue and motor vehicle fees collected in the prior year to be distributed &nbsp;as local highway aid.</span></p><p class="cs9E885863"><span class="csDD5E5F52">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs9E885863"><span class="csDD5E5F52">The Department of Transportation indicates the construction of ESVE on state highways and turnpikes, long term operation and maintenance, including power, communications, lights and paving and winter maintenance will require a significant &nbsp;unknown expense. &nbsp;Utility make ready charges and extension of power to such facilities may exceed construction costs. &nbsp;The requirement &nbsp;to purchase and lease the lowest emission vehicles available as practicable will still require the Department to perform additional analyses to determine which vehicles are appropriate and may affect field usage of such vehicles with limited charging options. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Changing the definitions of light duty trucks and passenger vehicles for the DOT fleet may impact employee efficiency and vehicle performance if the transportation of staff, materials, tools and equipment is compromised for the work task or for long distance travel. &nbsp;The department would require the use of outside consultants to develop and maintain a plan for transition of its vehicle fleet to entirely ZEVs. &nbsp;The total cumulative fiscal impact of these provisions is indeterminable but is expected to be in the tens of millions of dollars.</span></p><p class="cs9E885863"><span class="csDD5E5F52">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs9E885863"><span class="csDD5E5F52">The New Hampshire Municipal Association states the rebate program may provide additional revenue to municipalities to offset the cost of publicly accessible chargers but the purchase of this equipment is voluntary and therefore the amount of such revenue is indeterminable. &nbsp;The use of fees under RSA 261:154 would allow municipalities to utilize these existing fees for this purpose but it does not affect municipal revenues or expenditures. &nbsp;The provision for tax relief pursuant to RSA 79-E for EVSE on private property is also voluntary and would not change revenues or expenditures, but would shift the tax burden among taxpayers.</span></p><p class="cs9E885863"><span

community&quot; and requires a municipality to reimburse or provide such communities and property owners within such communities with services related to roads equivalent to what is provided for properties along public roads, including: removal of snow, ice, and other obstructions from the roads and streets; street lighting charges; collection of leaves and recyclable materials and collection or disposal of solid waste; and repairs, maintenance and replacement of water and sewer infrastructure within qualified private communities. &nbsp;Municipalities currently do not provide such services to private entities. &nbsp;To the extent that any municipality has such communities, there would be a significant but variable increase in expenditures to provide these services to this population. &nbsp;The increase in municipal expenditures is therefore indeterminable. &nbsp;There is no increase in municipal revenues. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs9E885863"><span class="csDD5E5F52">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs9E885863"><span class="csDD5E5F52">The bill also requires municipalities to repair class VI roads, which is currently not done and will similarly require an indeterminable expense that varies by municipality.</span></p><p class="cs9E885863"><span class="csDD5E5F52">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csF0A1D375"><span class="cs5925EB86">AGENCIES
