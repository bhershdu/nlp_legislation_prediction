environmental protection agency has recognized that reusing and recycling materials conserves natural resources reduces waste prevents pollution reduces greenhouse gasses contributing to climate change and serves as an important economic driver helping to create jobs and tax revenue the purpose of this act is to facilitate recycling of greater amounts and more types of plastics by ensuring that advanced plastic recycling technologies in new hampshire protect the public health and safety by being appropriately regulated as manufacturers under new hampshire s applicable statutes and departmental rules relative to air water waste and land use furthermore such facilities will comply with all applicable federal statutes including but not limited to the clean air act the clean water act and environmental protection agency rules governing hazardous waste new paragraphs solid waste management definitions amend rsa by inserting after paragraph i the following new paragraphs advanced recycling means a manufacturing process for the conversion of polymers and recovered feedstocks into basic raw materials feedstock chemicals and other products like waxes and lubricants through processes that include pyrolysis gasification depolymerization catalytic cracking reforming hydrogenation solvolysis and other similar technologies the recycled products produced at advanced recycling facilities include monomers oligomers plastics plastics and chemical feedstocks basic and unfinished chemicals waxes lubricants and coatings for the purposes of this chapter the primary products of advanced recycling shall not include hydrocarbons which are marketed sold or used as fuel for energy incidental products may be used for fuel only within the facility for the purposes of this chapter advanced recycling shall not be considered solid waste management solid waste processing waste processing treatment incineration or combustion advanced recycling facility means a facility that receives stores and converts polymers and recovered feedstock it receives using advanced recycling an advanced recycling facility shall be considered a manufacturing facility for the purpose of this chapter advanced recycling facility shall not include a facility solid waste facility solid waste management facility waste management facility processing treatment facility solid waste collection storage and transfer facility processing facility treatment facility or an incinerator solid waste management definition of certified product amend rsa to read as follows certified product means a constituent of solid waste which is no longer regulated as a solid waste when certified by the department to be recyclable for its original use or alternate uses and which poses no greater risk to the environment public health and safety than exists by producing distributing using or disposing comparable products which are not products derived from advanced recycling shall not be considered products or require certification as products new paragraph solid waste management definitions amend rsa by inserting after paragraph v the following new paragraph depolymerization means a manufacturing process where polymers are broken into smaller molecules such as monomers oligomers plastic or chemical feedstocks or other basic raw materials new paragraph solid waste management definitions amend rsa by inserting after paragraph the following new paragraph gasification means a manufacturing process through which recovered feedstocks are heated and converted into synthesis gas in an atmosphere and the mixture is converted into valuable raw materials new paragraph solid waste management definitions amend rsa by inserting after paragraph xv the following new paragraph polymer means a plastic to which all of the following apply a the plastic is derived from industrial commercial agricultural or domestic activities b the plastic is not mixed with solid waste or hazardous waste c the plastic s use or intended use is as a feedstock for mechanical or chemical recycling d the plastic has been sorted from solid waste and other regulated waste but may contain residual amounts of solid waste such as organic material and incidental contaminants or impurities such as paper labels and metal rings new paragraphs solid waste management definitions amend rsa by inserting after paragraph xviii the following new paragraphs pyrolysis means a manufacturing process through which polymers are heated in the absence of oxygen sometimes in the presence of catalysts until thermally decomposed and are then cooled and condensed the resulting chemicals when separated from wastes can provide raw materials for the production of plastics lubricants waxes and other industrially useful chemicals recovered feedstock means one or more of the following materials that has been processed so it may be used as feedstock in an advanced recycling facility a polymers b materials for which the united states environmental protection agency has made a non waste determination pursuant to f r c or has otherwise determined are feedstocks and not solid waste c recovered feedstock does not include unprocessed municipal solid waste d recovered feedstock is not mixed with solid waste or hazardous waste onsite or during processing at an advanced recycling facility solid waste management definitions amend rsa xxii to read as follows solid waste means any matter consisting of putrescible material refuse residue from an air pollution control facility and other discarded or abandoned material it includes solid liquid semisolid or contained gaseous material resulting from industrial commercial mining and agricultural operations and from community activities for purposes of this chapter it does not include hazardous waste as defined in rsa solid or dissolved materials in irrigation return flows cut or uprooted tree stumps buried with local approval if required provided that such burial locations are not located within feet of any drinking water supply municipal and industrial discharges which are point sources subject to permits under section of the federal water pollution control act as amended source special nuclear or material as defined by the atomic energy act of as amended or septage or sludge as defined in rsa and or polymers and recovered feedstocks converted at an advanced recycling facility or held at such facility prior to conversion new paragraph solid waste management definition amend rsa by inserting after paragraph xxii the following new paragraph solvolysis means a manufacturing process through which polymers are purified with the aid of solvents while heated at low temperatures and or pressurized to make useful products allowing additives and contaminants to be removed the products of solvolysis include monomers intermediates and valuable chemicals and raw materials the process includes but is not limited to hydrolysis amylolysis ammonolysis methanolysis and glycolysis new subdivision solid waste management regulation of advanced recycling amend rsa by inserting after section the following new subdivision regulation of advanced recycling regulation of advanced recycling the department shall regulate advanced recycling facilities as manufacturing facilities an advanced recycling facility and the products and of advanced recycling shall be subject to applicable statutes and departmental rules relative to air water waste and land use the department may enter and inspect any advanced recycling facility to determine whether storage of materials prior to advanced recycling is a nuisance or poses a threat to the environment the department may utilize its enforcement authorities under rsa to require abatement of the nuisance or threat if found the department may enter and inspect any advanced recycling facility to ensure compliance with all applicable statutes and departmental rules relative to air water waste and land use and take any enforcement actions necessary products of advanced recycling shall not be considered products or fuel and shall not be subject to the provisions of this chapter and rules created under its authority relating to products and fuel including but limited to the certification provisions of department of environmental services rule advanced recycling facilities shall give priority to utilizing polymers and recovered feedstocks generated within the state reporting for waste reduction goals for the purpose of reporting recycling rates all advanced recycling facilities shall report the source of polymers including the state or country of origin the mass of polymer processed the mass of recycled product the mass of residual material and the mass of processed material used for fuel to the department recycled product shall not include any residual material product used for fuel or feedstock converted to product"
