meter point between the distribution system under state jurisdiction and transmission facilities under federal jurisdiction such that transmission charges allocated to the distribution utility are reduced from what they otherwise would be absent the electricity exported to the distribution grid by the limited producer during hours of coincident peak on which transmission costs are allocated such credit shall be based on measurement of exports to the distribution grid at the retail meter point without additional credit for avoided line and transformation losses between retail meter points
