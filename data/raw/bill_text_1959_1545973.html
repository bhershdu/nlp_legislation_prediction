2021 and again on March 25, 2022, which it has not provided as of May 2, 2022.</span></p><p class="csF0A1D375"><span class="csDD5E5F52">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csF0A1D375"><span class="cs5925EB86">METHODOLOGY:</span></p><p class="cs9E885863"><span class="csDD5E5F52">This bill creates a dedicated, non-lapsing fund, administered by the New Hampshire Department of Justice (DOJ), to address claims of abuse at the youth development center. &nbsp;Although the settlement process itself will be handled by the Judicial Branch, the bill directs the DOJ to make payments and pay for the administration of the process from the dedicated fund. &nbsp;The bill further authorizes the DOJ to enter into memoranda of understanding with the Judicial Branch or any other state agency as needed to compensate them for services performed in furtherance of the bill&#39;s objectives. &nbsp;In order to pay for the administration and settlement of claims, the bill makes a non-lapsing appropriation of $100 million for the biennium ending June 30, 2023, to come from the revenue stabilization reserve account, also known as the &quot;rainy day fund.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs9E885863"><span class="csDD5E5F52">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs9E885863"><span class="csDD5E5F52">The Judicial Branch notes that the bill creates a claims administer position within the Branch, to be paid no more than the salary of an active Superior Court justice (approximately 165,000 as of May 2022). &nbsp;Consistent with the text of the bill, the Branch assumes that the salary and benefits of this position, as well as those of any necessary support staff, will come from the settlement fund described above. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs9E885863"><span class="csDD5E5F52">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs9E885863"><span class="csDD5E5F52">The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) notes that since the Judicial Branch and the DOJ have complete authority over the settlement and payment processes, respectively, there is no fiscal impact to DHHS as a result of the administration of the fund or the payout of settlements. &nbsp;However, as the bill will result in the need for investigation and resolution of the potentially hundreds of claims that may be filed, DHHS anticipates a fiscal impact to the agency&rsquo;s Division for Children, Youth and Families (DCYF). &nbsp;Specifically, the bill may require additional DCYF staff time to do the following: (1) participate in investigations, (2) produce electronic and paper records, (3) and prepare for and participate in interviews and hearings. &nbsp;DHHS assumes that this process will result in the need for additional staff, but that the number of such staff is indeterminable because the Department is unable to predict either the number of former youth who will file claims or the complexity of said claims. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs9E885863"><span
