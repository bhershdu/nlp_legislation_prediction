hereunder within 60 days of its submission shall constitute approval thereof. &nbsp;A municipality or county may submit a plan that is revised to comply with applicable requirements at any time and start the review process over. &nbsp;Any plan submitted to the commission under this paragraph shall also be submitted on the same date to the office of the consumer advocate under RSA 363:28 and any electric distribution utility providing service within the jurisdiction of the municipality or county. &nbsp;The consumer advocate, utilities, and members of the public may file comments about such plans within the first 21 days of their submission. &nbsp;Commission review and approval of electric aggregation plans shall not require a contested case but shall allow time for submission and consideration of any such comments.</span></p><p class="csF0A1D375" style="tab-stops:left 18pt left 36pt left 54pt left 72pt left 90pt;"><span class="csDD5E5F52">\t\tIII. &nbsp;If the plan is adopted or once adopted is revised to include an opt-out service, the municipality or county shall mail written notification to each retail electric customer within the municipality or county service area. &nbsp;To enable such mailed notification and notwithstanding RSA 363:38, after an aggregation plan is duly approved the electric distribution utility or utilities serving an adopting municipality or county shall provide to such municipality or county a current list of the names and mailing addresses of all electric customers taking distribution service within the municipality or county service area, and for such customers on utility provided default service, the account numbers and any other information necessary for successful enrollment in the aggregation. &nbsp;Notification shall include a description of the aggregation program, the implications to the municipality or county, and the rights and responsibilities that the participants will have under the program, and if provided on an opt-out basis, the fixed rate or charges that will apply. &nbsp;No retail electric customer shall be included in a program in which the customer does not know all of the rates or charges the customer may be subject to at least 30 days in advance and has the option, for a period of not less than 30 days from the date of the mailing, to opt out of being enrolled in such program, unless the customer affirmatively responds to the notification or requests in writing to be included in the program.</span></p><p class="csF0A1D375" style="tab-stops:left 18pt left 36pt left 54pt left 72pt left

be offered by or through the aggregation shall be on an opt-in basis unless the adopted aggregation plan explicitly creates an opt-out alternative default energy service program where the rate or price is known at least 30 days in advance of its application and, for a period of not less than 30 days from the date notification is mailed, the customer has the opportunity to opt out of being enrolled in such program, by return postcard, website, or such additional means as may be provided. &nbsp;Customers who are on default service provided by an electric distribution utility shall be enrolled by the aggregator in an aggregation provided alternative default service if they do not elect to opt out. &nbsp;Customers opting out will instead remain on utility provided default service. &nbsp;Customers taking energy service from a competitive electricity supplier shall not be enrolled in any aggregation program, unless they voluntarily opt in. </span></p><p class="csF0A1D375"

by paragraph III shall initially be enrolled in utility provided default service unless the customer has relocated within a single utility&rsquo;s service area and is continuing service with a competitive supplier or a municipal or county aggregation program. &nbsp;Upon request of an aggregator, but not more frequently than monthly and notwithstanding RSA 363:38, the utility shall make available to each operating municipal aggregation, or county aggregation where there is no municipal aggregation, the names, account numbers, mailing addresses, and any other information necessary for successful enrollment in the aggregation of customers that are new to or then currently on electric distribution utility provided default service after they have provided the customer list for the initial customer mailing required by paragraph III and that are located within the aggregation service area. &nbsp;The aggregation shall periodically mail a written notification to such new customers that have not previously opted out of the aggregator&rsquo;s service and shall enroll them in the aggregation consistent with the opt-in or opt-out requirements of this paragraph and paragraph III.</span></p><p class="csF0A1D375" style="tab-stops:left 18pt left 36pt left 54pt left 72pt left 90pt;"><span class="csDD5E5F52">\t\tVII. &nbsp;Municipal aggregations shall take priority or

elect to transfer to utility provided default service or to transfer to a competitive electricity supplier with adequate notice in advance of the next regular meter reading by the distribution utility, in the same manner as if they were on utility provided default service or as approved by the commission. &nbsp;No such customer shall be required to pay any exit fee or charge for such transfer. &nbsp;Customers requesting transfer of supply service upon dates other than on the next available regular meter reading date may be charged an off-cycle meter reading and billing charge. &nbsp;Upon request of the customer the aggregator shall transfer the customer back to utility provided default service. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="csF0A1D375" style="tab-stops:left 18pt left 36pt left

municipality or county. &nbsp;In all cases the establishment of an opt-out default service program shall be approved as provided in paragraphs I, II, and IV.</span></p><p class="csF0A1D375"

extent authorities granted to municipalities and counties by this chapter materially affect the interests of electric distribution utilities and their customers, to reasonably balance such interests with those of municipalities and counties for the public good, which may also be done through adjudicative proceedings to the extent specified or not addressed in rules. &nbsp;Such rules shall include but not be limited to rules governing the relationship between municipal and county aggregators and distribution utilities, metering, billing, access to customer data for planning and operation of aggregations, notice of the commencement or termination of aggregation services and products, and the reestablishment of a municipal or county aggregation that has substantially ceased to provide services. &nbsp;Where the commission has adopted rules in conformity with this chapter, complaints to and proceedings before the commission shall not be subject to RSA 541-A:29 or RSA

related services less a discount percentage rate equal to the utility&rsquo;s actual uncollectible rate, adjusted to recover capitalized and operating costs specific to the implementation and operation of the purchase of receivables program, including working capital. &nbsp;Additionally, such discount rate adjustments shall include a pro rata share of the cost of administering collection efforts such that the utility&rsquo;s participation in the purchase of receivables program shall not require the utility or non-participating consumers to assume any costs arising from its use. &nbsp;Such pro rata costs must include, but not be limited to, any increases in the utility&rsquo;s bad debt write-offs attributable to participants in the purchase of receivables program, as approved by the commission. &nbsp;However, the allocation of costs arising from different rate components and determination of the uncollectible rate shall be equitably allocated between such suppliers, utility provided default service, and other utility charges that are a part of consolidated billing by the utility as approved by the commission. &nbsp;The discount percentage rate shall be subject to
