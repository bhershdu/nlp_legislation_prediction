Advocate until such time that the facility is fully operational. &nbsp;The bill authorizes the Governor, with approval of the &nbsp;Fiscal Committee of the General Court to authorize an extension of the completion date, no later than two years following the initial anticipated completion date of June 30, 2024.</span></p><p class="cs9E885863"><span class="csDD5E5F52">The DHHS indicates the bill will increase state revenues and expenditures by an indeterminable amount in FY 2023 through FY 2025. &nbsp;The appropriation of $15,000,000 for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2023 will be applied to the costs to design and build the new facility. &nbsp;In the long term, the Department anticipates indeterminable savings in operating costs when compared to the operating costs of the current SYSC facility.</span></p><p class="cs9E885863"><span class="csDD5E5F52">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs9E885863"><span class="csDD5E5F52">The DAS states that, following closure of the existing SYSC facility, annual carrying costs will be approximately $447,000. &nbsp;Such costs could potentially increase due to rising energy prices. &nbsp;The DAS further anticipates that, given the highly specialized nature of the facility, it could take at least two years to find a market value buyer for the property. &nbsp;This time line could also be prolonged by the existence of historical buildings on site and the possible need for an environmental impact assessment. &nbsp;The DAS estimates pre-disposal costs (appraisal, land survey, documentation of historical buildings, etc.) at a minimum of $60,000. &nbsp;Finally, DAS notes that it would retain a broker to market the property, and that the broker&#39;s commission would be paid out of proceeds, reducing the amount deposited into the state general fund. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs9E885863"><span class="csDD5E5F52">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs9E885863"><span class="csDD5E5F52">This bill makes an appropriation of $15,000,000 for the
